## [3.0.1] - 2025-10-26

### ðŸ”§ Settings & Stability Improvements

#### Added
- **options_ui** definition to both manifest.v2.json and manifest.v3.json for proper settings page integration
- **Dark mode** storage support in StorageData interface with default value
- Comprehensive **error handling** for BrowserAdapter storage operations (get/set/remove)
- **Migration logic** for lineHeight values > 2.0 to automatically correct to 1.5
- Detailed **error messages** in options page with specific error information
- Unit tests for BrowserAdapter error handling scenarios
- Unit tests for StorageManager lineHeight migration logic

#### Changed
- **lineHeight default value** from 4 to 1.5 to match UI specifications (1.0-2.0 range)
- Optimized **StorageManager instantiation** using React's useMemo in useSettings and popup/App
- Refactored BrowserAdapter to use **handleRuntimeError** common function, eliminating code duplication
- Enhanced error logging with console.error for debugging

#### Fixed
- Settings page not opening from browser extension UI
- Potential memory leaks from repeated StorageManager instantiation

- Dark mode settings not being saved or loaded properly

#### Technical Details
- BrowserAdapter: Added chrome.runtime.lastError validation in all storage methods
- StorageManager: Automatic data migration for invalid lineHeight values
